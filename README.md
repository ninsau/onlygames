# OnlyGames ðŸŽ®

Welcome to **OnlyGames**, a cozy corner on the internet where I unleash my creativity by building rip-offs of popular word games that I cherish. This project acts as a playground for me to hone my coding skills, discover new technologies, and craft a collection of downgraded yet delightful versions of these games. Not just for me, but for my friends and anyone else who stumbles upon this digital treasure trove. Feel the nostalgia, enjoy the simplicity, and perhaps, learn a thing or two about coding along the way.

## Live Demo ðŸš€

Experience the games live on [onlygames-two.vercel.app](https://onlygames-two.vercel.app).

## Games ðŸŽ²

The repository houses a growing collection of games, each with its unique twist and learning curve. Here are some of the games you'll find:

1. **Wordle Rip-off**: A tribute to the classic, with a simpler look yet the same mind-boggling fun.
2. _(More games coming soon as inspiration strikes and code compiles...)_

## Why Rip-offs? ðŸ¤”

The aim is not to plagiarize, but to learn and create. By recreating these games, I delve deeper into the intricacies of game development, UI/UX design, and coding. Each line of code pushes my understanding a little further and brings a fresh batch of challenges to tackle.
